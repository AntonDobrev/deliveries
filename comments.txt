structure; .store files?

	medium
connectivity and sync stuff - in a service
enums - TS mapping from name to value
getData(contentTypeName) on EverliveService
validation on create/update
confirmation on edit
placeholders/labels for all inputs
services/events.service.ts - not used
nsHyperlink.directive - not used
notifications.service.ts - lots of repetition
item in many places can be renamed to something more specific
i believe there are more unused Input/Output properties on various components
.main-container is a strange selector for a component with a view - better use an element
details not updated cause of cloning and not using observable in details screen

	minor
empty states?
filter not per tab?
